Simple code to turn 3 led's into a stop light configuration. Beginner project that helps understand how mcirocontrollers work, basics of circuitry, and programming.

HARDWARE:
on your board of choice, we will be wiring from pin 4 to a resistor, from the other side of the resistor to the long leg of a red led, and from the short leg of the led to ground. Repeat this for pins 5 and 6 using yellow led for 5 and green led for 6.

Now the circuit is wired, you can copy the code from the "main" section of this repository and paste it into arduino IDE. Make sure the correct board and port is selected, then upload the code.

You should now see your stoplight light up!
